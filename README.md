# BrickLinkDataAnaysisTool
Once you build the application, the executable can be found in BrickLinkDataAnaysisTool/GUI/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/GUI.exe

To use the application you will need to register within the application using valid BrickLink API credentials.
I can provide you with my own personal BrickLink API credentials if you require; contact me via my student email b6014570@my.shu.ac.uk
